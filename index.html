                        <p>Robotics is an interdisciplinary branch of engineering that includes mechanical engineering,
                            electrical engineering, computer engineering, control engineering and others. It deals with
                            design, construction and use of robots, as well as computer systems for their control,
                            sensory feedback, and information processing. It may overlap with different fields such as
                            electronics, computer science, mechatronics, artificial intelligence, nanotechnology and
                            bioengineering. Robotics was initially and for a long time guided by needs in industry.
                            Indeed, the early years of robotics was largely focused on robotic manipulators, mainly used
                            for simple and repetitive automation tasks. The first industrial robot manipulator appeared
                            in 1961 in the assembly lines of General Motors. Year after year, the progress of robotics
                            and automation, as well as their associated innovative applications, have been noticed every
                            day through the consideration of more and more complex tasks needing higher performances;
                            such as those for operating in dangerous and hazardous environments. These complex and
                            challenging tasks require a deeply understanding of robotic systems in different points of
                            view, including mechanical design, kinematic and dynamic modelling, sensing, actuation,
                            control design, optimization, etc. Nowadays, robotics is highly advanced, including
                            different fields and applications; namely industrial robotics, mobile robotics, bioinspired
                            robotics, micro-robotics, humanoid robotics, aerial robotics, space robotics, marine
                            robotics, medical robotics, service robotics, wearable robotics, etc. This talk will give an
                            overview of most of these robotic fields through various videos illustrating needs,
                            challenges and applications.</p>

                        <p>Underactuated mechanical systems are those systems with less control inputs than generalized
                            coordinates (degrees of freedom) i.e they have generalized coordinates that are not
                            actuated, and this is a source of dynamic constraints which are generally non integrable and
                            therefore second order non-holonomic. Many examples of such systems exist, mainly in
                            robotics, they include, among others, the underactuated robot manipulators, the gymnast
                            robots and particularly the acrobot, the pendubot, the Planar Vertical Takeoff and Landing
                            (PVTOL) aircrafts, some undersea vehicles and other mobile robots. Another basic feature of
                            this class of systems is the nonlinear dynamics that they have; moreover their actuated
                            coordinates are nonlinearly coupled with the unactuated coordinates.
                            This talk deals with control of underactuated mechanical systems, where two main problems
                            have been studied; the first one concerns stabilization around unstable equilibrium point,
                            whereas the second one deals with stable limit cycle generation.
                            The proposed control methods are illustrated through numerical simulations as well as
                            real-time experiments on different examples of underactuated mechanical systems and mainly
                            the inertia wheel inverted pendulum.</p>

                        <p>Serial robot manipulators consist of a set of sequentially connected links, forming an open
                            kinematic chain. These robots are mainly characterized by their large workspace and their
                            high dexterity. However, in order to perform tasks requiring high speeds/accelerations and
                            high precision; such robots are not always recommended because of their lack of stiffness
                            and accuracy. Indeed, parallel kinematic manipulators (PKMs) are more suitable for such
                            tasks. The main idea of their mechanical structure consists in using at least two kinematic
                            chains linking the fixed base to the travelling plate, where each of these chains contains
                            at least one actuator. This allows for a distribution of the load between the chains. PKMs
                            have important advantages with respect to their serial counterparts in terms of stiffness,
                            speed, accuracy and payload. However, these robots are characterized by their highly
                            nonlinear dynamics, actuation redundancy, kinematic redundancy, uncertainties,
                            singularities, etc. Besides, when interested in high speed robotized repetitive
                            applications, such as food packaging tasks, the key idea relies in looking for short cycle
                            times. This talk will give an overview of some proposed advanced control solutions for
                            high-speed applications of PKMs in food packaging tasks. The proposed solutions are mainly
                            based on nonlinear adaptive control techniques and have been validated through real-time
                            experiments on different prototypes.</p>

                        <p>Underwater vehicles have gained a widespread interest in the last decades, from various
                            research communities (design, actuation, perception, modelling, control, etc), given the
                            multiple tasks they can accomplish. Their applications are multiple and various in different
                            fields such as dams’ inspection, oil and gas industry, fish farms, wind parks, hydroelectric
                            power stations, underwater archeology, ocean cartography, air crash and environmental
                            investigations, etc. Control of underwater vehicles is a thoroughly investigated subject but
                            still an open research problem. Indeed, when we are interested in autonomous control of
                            underwater vehicles (ROVs, AUVs, ASVs, bioinspired, etc) different control challenges may
                            arise. They are mainly due to the inherent high nonlinearities and time varying behavior of
                            their dynamics subject to hydrodynamic effects and environmental disturbances. This talk
                            will be focused control challenges of small tethered underwater vehicles and some proposed
                            control solutions. Different control solutions, mainly issued from adaptive control, will be
                            then presented and discussed. All the proposed controllers will be illustrated through

                        <p>Walking gait control is one of the most important research problems in humanoid and wearable
                            robotics.
                            Indeed, when interested in walking gait control two inherent challenging issues may arise;
                            namely pattern generation and control design. This presentation will be focused on the
                            second challenge dealing with control design for dynamic walking. It will be organized
                            around two main parts; the first one is a general introduction to humanoid robotics,
                            including a brief its basic principles, before emphasizing the problem formulation involving
                            the two above mentioned challenges.
                            The second part will be devoted to walking gait control, where this problem is resolved
                            through a human-data-based control architecture for pattern generation and dynamic walking
                            control. The proposed method in this case deals with whole-body control, where a motion
                            capture system is used to acquire the necessary data to reproduce human-like motions on a
                            humanoid robot. However, unlike most of the techniques from the literature, where a big
                            amount of data is used, only feet and CoM positions are needed to describe the the most
                            relevant features of a human walking. The redundancy in the humanoid model is then
                            considered to track these two objectives using task formalism. The proposed solution is
                            validated through numerical simulations as well as real-time experiments on the humanoid
                            robot HOAP3, for different motion scenarios</p>

                            particular interest these last decades due to the highly increasing rate of dependent
                            people. The rise in life expectancy is set to continue; combined with the decrease in birth
                            rates, this should accelerate more the aging of the population. Consequently, this will
                            certainly have a great impact on the development of assistive wearable devices.
                            Thanks to the latest advances in portable device technologies in terms of
                            compact/miniaturized design, low cost and energy consumption, their wearability has known an
                            important development. Indeed, human wearable devices such as exoskeletons, wearable
                            bio-sensors and wearable stimulators are no more considered as fiction science. Furthermore,
                            this field is attracting more and more researchers from different communities (mechanical
                            design, sensors, actuators, control design, etc.) in the last decade. In terms of data
                            measurement, different sensing systems are often used in wearable devices, namely EMG
                            (muscular activities), IMU (human posture), Force sensors (contact with the ground), etc.
                            This talk will be focused on wearables robotics challenges, recent advances in this field,
                            and some proposed control solutions for exoskeletons. The proposed control solutions will be
