                        Ahmed CHEMORI received the M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in automatic control from the Polytechnic
                        Institute of Grenoble, France, in 2001 and 2005, respectively. During the 2004-2005 academic
                        year, he was a Research and Teaching Assistant at the Laboratoire de Signaux et Systèmes (LSS,
                        CentraleSupélec) and at Université Paris 11. He subsequently joined GIPSA-lab (formerly LAG) as
                        a CNRS postdoctoral researcher. He is currently a Senior Researcher at the CNRS in automatic
                        control and robotics, affiliated with LIRMM laboratory. His research interests include nonlinear
                        control (robust, adaptive, and predictive approaches) and their real-time applications in
                        various areas of robotics, including parallel robotics, underwater robotics, wearable robotics,
                        and underactuated systems. He is the author or co-author of more than 190 scientific
                        publications, including journal articles, patents, books, book chapters, and conference
                        proceedings. He has co-supervised 26 Ph.D. theses (including 21 defended) and more than 40 M.Sc.
                        theses. He currently serves as a Technical Editor for the journal IEEE/ASME Transactions on
                        Mechatronics. He has also served as a TPC/IPC member and Associate Editor for several
                        international conferences, including IEEE IROS, IEEE RO-MAN, IFAC ALCOS, IFAC CAMS, and the IFAC
                        World Congress, among others, and has organized multiple scientific events. He is an IEEE Senior
                        Member and an IFAC member of Technical Committees TC1.2 (Adaptive and Learning Systems), TC4.2
                        (Mechatronic Systems), TC4.3 (Robotics), and TC7.2 (Marine Systems).

                            electrical engineering, computer engineering, control engineering and others. It deals with
                            design, construction and use of robots, as well as computer systems for their control,
                            sensory feedback, and information processing. It may overlap with different fields such as
                            electronics, computer science, mechatronics, artificial intelligence, nanotechnology and
                            bioengineering. Robotics was initially and for a long time guided by needs in industry.
                            Indeed, the early years of robotics was largely focused on robotic manipulators, mainly used
                            for simple and repetitive automation tasks. The first industrial robot manipulator appeared
                            in 1961 in the assembly lines of General Motors. Year after year, the progress of robotics
                            and automation, as well as their associated innovative applications, have been noticed every
                            day through the consideration of more and more complex tasks needing higher performances;
                            such as those for operating in dangerous and hazardous environments. These complex and
                            challenging tasks require a deeply understanding of robotic systems in different points of
                            view, including mechanical design, kinematic and dynamic modelling, sensing, actuation,
                            control design, optimization, etc. Nowadays, robotics is highly advanced, including
                            different fields and applications; namely industrial robotics, mobile robotics, bioinspired
                            robotics, micro-robotics, humanoid robotics, aerial robotics, space robotics, marine
                            robotics, medical robotics, service robotics, wearable robotics, etc. This talk will give an
                            overview of most of these robotic fields through various videos illustrating needs,
                            challenges and applications.</p>
